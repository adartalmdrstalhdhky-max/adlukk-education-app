# 📘 Adlk Core — The Official Education Platform Engine  
The complete backend & client foundation for the **Adlk Smart School System**, designed to power the future of smart education in Yemen and around the world.

---

## 🚀 Vision  
Adlik Core is the heart of the upcoming **Adlk Smart School Application**, which will serve millions of students and teachers — both online and offline — in all regions, including rural areas with no internet access.

The system aims to solve real educational problems caused by school closures, lack of teachers, and lack of books.  
Adlik will become a complete school management ecosystem that works **with or without internet**, and synchronizes automatically when a connection becomes available.

---

## 🎯 Goals  
- Build a **complete school system** (manager, teachers, classes, students).  
- Provide **all Yemeni curricula** (Grades 1–12).  
- Work **offline-first** for rural villages.  
- Include a built-in **AI learning assistant** using -style models.  
- Provide school analytics, progress tracking, exams, and certificates.  
- Make the app expandable globally in the future.
